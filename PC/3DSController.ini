Default port is 8889, if you change this, you must change it in the 3DS's 3DSController.ini as well, Throttle controls the delay between checking for new packets (in milliseconds), a high number will have slightly more lag between pressing a button on the 3DS and receiving it on the PC,
however will make the application use less CPU. In my experience, 20 is a reasonable throttling amount,
Mouse Speed controls how fast the Circle Pad or Touch Screen moves the mouse. If set to 0 and using the Touch Screen, it will set to the absolute position, rather than moving relatively to last position,
vJoy Device chooses which device to connect to. Set this to 2 in a second instance of 3DSController to use a second 3DS at the same time, perhaps for multiplayer.




Circle Pad, C Stick and Touch can be MOUSE, JOYSTICK1, or JOYSTICK2.
JOYSTICK1 uses X and Y. JOYSTICK2 uses Rx and Ry.
These are axes 0, 1, 3 and 4 respectively, leaving 2 and 5 unused.
KEYS will enable Pad directions (eg. Pad Left, C Stick Right) to map to regular keys (no vJoy necessary).
D Pad can be KEYS or POV. POV will automatically choose a continuous or 4 directional POV hat depending on what is set in your vJoy Config.

KEYS will allow Left, Right and etc. to be buttons as previously.


Buttons can be a letter for a keyboard key (like Q, W, E, R, T, or Y), a special keyboard key (like SPACE, CLICK, RIGHT CLICK, ENTER, BACKSPACE, SHIFT, TAB, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, WINDOWS, ESCAPE, CONTROL or ALT), or a joypad button (JOY1, JOY2, JOY3, to JOY16).
If you want to use JOY9 through JOY16 you need to reconfigure vJoy. Search for vJoy Config in your start menu and set buttons to 16.

Alternatively, you can disable any key by binding it to NONE.

Touch will define the Touchscreen behaviour and it will be overriden if the Keyboardcombo is used (L+R+X) to bring the keyboard up. Use MOUSE to control the Mouse with the touchscreen and adjust its speed with the Mouse Speed parameter. If set to 0 it will map absolute positions of the touchscreen to the computer screen. Use TAP to assign tapping/holding the screen to the desired Key/Button (Defined below with Tap). Use REGIONS to map 4 sections of the screen to 4 more buttons/keys defined with Region LT, Region RT, Region LB and Region RB for Left-Top, Right-Top, Left-Bottom and Right-Bottom respectively. REGIONS behaviour is intended to hold the pressed region until release even if the point pressed is changed to another region to avoid slips of finger while holding.




Make sure to use a single space, not a tab for separating settings,
